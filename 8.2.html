<p> My parent div has a font set of 24px</p>
<p class='rem2'>I am 1rem so i am the root font which is 16px. Rem's stay constant where ever they are
</p>
<p class='em2'>I am 1em which is 24px as my parent now had a font-size of 24px. EM's change whenever their parents change font size.
</p>
<p class='em3'>We often set padding in ems or rems as it stays in proportion to text size when user zoom in or change font size.
